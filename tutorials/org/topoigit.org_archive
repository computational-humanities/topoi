After changing to the working folder, first check if you are in the correct branch
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 git branch
#+END_SRC

If that is not the case, change to it by
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git checkout name_of_branch
#+END_SRC

There might be errors due to unsaved changes of files in the master branch.

On the development branch, you ca work as usual, e.g. add a test file to a new folder. 

Running 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
  git status
#+END_SRC

should show the changed, deleted, or new file colored in red. This indicates, that the file is not 
yet in the staging area, an intermediate state of files to be send to the online version of the branch.

To make the changes part of this staging area, use
#+BEGIN_SRC 
 git add filename1 filename2 ...
#+END_SRC
to add all changes that should be published. 

To bring the changes to the online version of the branch use first
#+BEGIN_SRC 
 git commit -m 'useful commit message describing the changes'
#+END_SRC

The changes are now logged for being ready to move to the online repository. However, they are
not yet there! 

You could continue working, adding changes to bundle a new commit. To finally send them online, run
#+BEGIN_SRC 
    git push origin name_of_branch
#+END_SRC
This will send the bundled changes, called commits, to the online version of your working branch.
